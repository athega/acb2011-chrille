This is the result of the Athega Code Base 2011 hack day for me, Christian Lizell. It's a rather useless application that on the server side communicates with Harvest and on the client side uses RGraph to present the results.

## Technologies explored

 - [Harvest API](http://www.getharvest.com/api/)
 - [RGraph](http://www.rgraph.net/)
 - [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org/)
 - [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/)

### Environment

If you's like to take the code out for a little spin, you will have to set the following environment variables
- *HARVEST_DOMAIN* the subdomain part of .harvestapp.com
- HARVEST_USER
- HARVEST_PASSWORD
